Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
* This purpose of this project was to create an agent that can win the 'pirate game'. The agent would navigate the game and find the correct path in this _pathfinding problem_. Most of the source code was given with the exception of the Q-learning implenetation which I created myself.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    * Computer scientist help design and create software that solves complex problems. This helps us make continuos advancements in technology and society by facilitating previously difficult or time-consuming tasks.
  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    * As a computer scientist, the initial step to approaching a problem is getting a clear understanding of what the expected outcome is. The second step is reading and analyzing all the 'known' information then creating a plan for executing the solution. After the solution is implemented, it needs to be tested until it is not flawed and succesfully solves the problem.
  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    * The ethical responsibilites a computer scientist must abide to to the end user are: cause no harm and remain unbiased. There are several areas of computer science that can cause harm, specially in the field of AI, but it is the computer scientist's responsibility to avoid that.
